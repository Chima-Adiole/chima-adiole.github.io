I am currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Rice University. My research is on program synthesis and I am advised by [Chris Jermaine](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~cmj4/). My current work focuses on developing improved code generation models by performing deeper analysis of programs generated by large language models, using techniques from reinforcement learning and graph representation learning. In addition to building machine learning models for code, I am interested in data science applications in sustainability. I recently contributed to the [IFCE-Rice-SENAI AI for Sustainability and Resilience to Natural Disasters](https://www.100kstrongamericas.org/ifce-rice-senai-program-on-artificial-intelligence-for-urban-sustainability-and-resilience-to-natural-disasters-in-the-americas/) project by implementing a model for flood prediction. 

Having previously interned at Meta (formerly Facebook) and sustainability-focused non-profit JACSES, I am interested in working at the intersection between sustainability and technology - especially for the earth. I thrive in a client facing environment where I can work directly with people to solve problems and share new perspectives. 

Please see my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cadiole/) for full description of my work experiences in academia and industry.
