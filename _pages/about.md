I am currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Rice University. My research is on program synthesis and I am advised by [Chris Jermaine](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~cmj4/). My current work focuses on developing improved code generation models by performing deeper analysis of programs generated by large language models, using techniques from reinforcement learning and graph representation learning.

In addition to building machine learning models for code, I am also interested in data science applications to the public sector, especially for environment and climate modeling. I recently contributed to the [IFCE-Rice-SENAI AI for Sustainability and Resilience to Natural Disasters] (https://www.100kstrongamericas.org/ifce-rice-senai-program-on-artificial-intelligence-for-urban-sustainability-and-resilience-to-natural-disasters-in-the-americas/) project by implementing a machine learning model for flood prediction. Prior to college, I interned for a year at the Japan Center for Sustainable Environment and Society in Tokyo.
