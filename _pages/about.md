I am currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Rice University. My research is on program synthesis (a.k.a. machine learning for code) and I am advised by [Chris Jermaine](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~cmj4/). I previously worked at Meta and JACSES, and I thrive in a client facing environment where I can work directly with people to develop new technology, solve problems and share new perspectives.

Please see my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cadiole/) for full description of my work experiences in academia and industry.
