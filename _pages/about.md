I am currently a fifth-year MS student in the Department of Computer Science at Rice University where I am advised by [Chris Jermaine](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~cmj4/). I received a BA in Computer Science from Rice University in May 2023.

My research interests lie at the intersection between machine learning, software engineering and computational social science. My current work focuses on developing improved code generation models by performing deeper analysis of programs generated by LLMs adapted for program synthesis using techniques such as reinforcement learning. As an undergrad, I also had the opportunity to work on projects where I developed ML-based models with applications in domains such as economics, earth science and political science.
